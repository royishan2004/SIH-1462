The greatest danger from falling debris is just outside doorways and close to outer walls of buildings. Go to an open area away from trees, telephone poles, and buildings.</p></h3>

        <p class="info">Don't ignore signs of cracks or roaring sounds of sloping rocks, cracking of trees. Watch the channel of stormwater drainage and run-off water converge near your building. Donâ€™t take your way of exit through these paths during landslides or storms. Don't try to divert the pathway of debris flow to neighbours land as you will be liable to pay for the damage later on.</p></h3>
